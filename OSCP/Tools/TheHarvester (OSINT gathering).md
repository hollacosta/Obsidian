1. **Basic Email Harvesting:**
    To search for email addresses related to a domain, use the following command:
    `theHarvester -d example.com -l 500 -b google`
    
    - `-d example.com`: Replace with the target domain.
    - `-l 500`: Limits the number of results to 500 (adjust as needed).
    - `-b google`: Specifies the data source (in this case, Google).
2. **Enumerating Subdomains:**
    To enumerate subdomains of a target domain, use this command:
    `theHarvester -d example.com -l 500 -b bing`
    - `-b bing`: Uses Bing as the data source.
3. **Search with Shodan:**
    Shodan is a popular search engine for finding Internet-connected devices. You can use TheHarvester to search Shodan for information:
    `theHarvester -d example.com -l 500 -b shodan`
    - `-b shodan`: Uses Shodan as the data source.
4. **Searching for Hostnames:**
    To search for hostnames associated with a domain, you can use the `crtsh` data source:
    bashCopy code
    `theHarvester -d example.com -l 500 -b crtsh`
    - `-b crtsh`: Uses crt.sh as the data source.
5. **Output to a File:**
    By default, TheHarvester prints results to the console. To save results to a file, use the `-f` option:
    `theHarvester -d example.com -l 500 -b google -f results.txt`  
    This will save the results in a file named `results.txt` 
6. **Using API Keys:**
    Some data sources (like Shodan) may require API keys for access. You can specify API keys using the `-a` option.
    bashCopy code
    `theHarvester -d example.com -l 500 -b shodan -a YOUR_SHODAN_API_KEY
7. **Custom User-Agent:**
    To set a custom User-Agent header in HTTP requests (useful for avoiding rate limiting or detection), use the `-u` option:
    `theHarvester -d example.com -l 500 -b google -u "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.3"`
